So, all of this is great, but what am I actually up to currently?
Last Updated: 20 December 2024


## Professional
As of Feb 2024 I joined <https://rapidx.bio/> as employee number 3, **Founding Engineer** is the title.

This is my first adventure into startup the world and I am loving it. We're currently in the R&D/Prototying phase, so the weeks are filled with the nitty grity problem solving and design development that I really enjoy, and the pace of progress is truly insane!

The team are great and the exposure to the entrepreneurial side of things is new, weird, and intersting. 

I'm extremely excited to see where things go!

## Personal
Recently started messing around with making music using [https://strudel.cc/](https://strudel.cc/), the live coding environment.

Example of what Strudel can do: 
- [Switch Angel - Coding Trance Music (Full Narrated)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWXCCBsOMSg)
- [DJ_Dave - Live at Elsewhere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnmGjI8MmOE)

## Hobbies
I'm back into bouldering boi!
