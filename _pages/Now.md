So, all of this is great, but what am I actually up to currently?
Last Updated: 20 December 2024


## Professional
As of Feb 2024 I joined <https://rapidx.bio/> as employee number 3, **Founding Engineer** is the job title.

This is my first adventure into startup the world and I am loving it. We're currently in the R&D/Prototying phase, so the weeks are filled with the nitty grity problem solving and design development that I really enjoy, and the pace of progress is truly insane!

The team are great and the exposure to the entrepreneurial side of things is valuable experience. 

I'm extremely excited to see where things go!

## Personal
As you would imagine, startup life has somewhat taken over my personal time in that I have less of it, but also that the work is enguaging and fulfilling in a way which scratches the itch which most of my personal projects are striving towards. 

Recently I started messing around and learning some basic python and MatPlotLib.

## Hobbies
With my [M8 Headless Project](/M8-HEADLESS) complete it sparked an interest in music production and theory, whilst youtube shorts simaltaniously realised that I am a fan of metal music and led me to videos by [Nick Broomhall](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi_t2g66DL2SVW9YVHt9yaA). These resulted in me buying a used electric guitar, so I'm taking lessons.
