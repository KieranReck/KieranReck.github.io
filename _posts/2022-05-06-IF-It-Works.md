"If it works it ain't stupid" has never rung more true than when using post-it notes in engineering prototypes. They can be used as slip gauges, spacers, washers, and in any scenario where you need to precisely fill a gap.  

These little sticky back pieces of paper are conveniently stacked, sticky, and easy to incrementally remove until your post-its fit a gap perfectly. You can then measure the resulting stack, or simple trim off the excess and slip them into place as I did on a recent camera project.

The gap between my camera lens and the camera body was too thin for a washer or lock ring, leaving no way to keep the lens locked into focus. So I found the perfect number of post-its required, cut them into shape, and put them to work.
