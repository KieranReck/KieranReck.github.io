The sheet metal brackets I designed for an upcoming jig arrived and one thing was very apparent, I had put the large holes too close to the bend.

Thankfully, I had a feeling this might happen, so my design kept all critical holes away from any bends. The affected holes are only there to allow you to get an Allen Key to the screws at the rear of the bracket, so after grinding the front surface flat these brackets will still be functional.

On the plus side, the 180degree hem on the lower edge has come out wonderfully!

## Lessons Learned
- For a slot or hole < 25mm in diameter the minimum distance from top surface to the Hole centre should be:

Min. Distance = 2 Â· Sheet Thickness + Bend Radius

- [https://geomiq.com/](https://geomiq.com/sheet-metal-design-guide/) offer an extensive and free sheet metal design guide.
- Trust your instincts and design room for manufacturer error into your parts.
- 'Hems' are a great way to protect people from sharp sheet metal edges.
