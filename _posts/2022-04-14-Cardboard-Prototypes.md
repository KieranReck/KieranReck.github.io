Cheap, quick, easy, accessible, what other proof do you need that cardboard is the best prototyping material?

Last night I built this little prototype, a replica of the Erica Synths Dual ASR EG, a Module used in musical Synthesisers. I have been toying with the idea of getting into modular synthesis by building DIY modules and I was trying to determine a few design features/constraints. I saw this module online and I liked the spacing and layout, so why not build a cardboard one?

Combining cardboard with real switches takes the prototyping abilities to another level, this little thing has taught me infinitely more than looking at pictures online. From now on I will be prototyping this way for all future modules!

Wondering what the hell is modular synthesis is...check out the youtube channel that first exposed me to it, [Look Mum No Computer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCafxR2HWJRmMfSdyZXvZMTw).
